Check out the deployed Heroku-version of this app at http://tweether.io (the initial page load might be slow since it's hosted on a free tier)

## Running locally

First, make sure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com) installed on your computer.

Clone the repo, then run the following commands in the folder:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage

All the data is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, which means that signing up and posting tweets costs a small amount of ether. This is probably not something that people would be willing to pay for in the near future, but serves as a proof-of-concept.

## Learn how to create DApps like this

Check out my online course [Discover Ethereum & Solidity](https://www.ludu.co/course/ethereum) on Ludu to learn how to build Tweether from scratch, as well as how to build complete Dapps with Solidity, Truffle and modern frontend frameworks like Next.js.
